# Problem 26:
#     Reciprocal Cycles
#
# Description:
#     A unit fraction contains 1 in the numerator.
#     The decimal representation of the unit fractions with denominators 2 to 10 are given:
#         1/2   =   0.5
#         1/3   =   0.(3)
#         1/4   =   0.25
#         1/5   =   0.2
#         1/6   =   0.1(6)
#         1/7   =   0.(142857)
#         1/8   =   0.125
#         1/9   =   0.(1)
#         1/10  =   0.1
#     Where 0.1(6) means 0.166666..., and has a 1-digit recurring cycle.
#     It can be seen that 1/7 has a 6-digit recurring cycle.
#
#     Find the value of d < 1000 for which 1/d contains the longest recurring cycle in its decimal fraction part.

# Idea:
#     First consider the representation of a recurring fraction in decimal.
#     Suppose we have a number cycle `c` repeating in the span of `w` digits after the decimal point.
#     This would look like S = 0.(0...c)*, with zeros padded in front of `c` if len(c) < w.
#
#     Looking at this as an infinite geometric series, and manipulating:
#           S = 0.(0...c)*
#         = (1/10^w) * (Sum(c * 10^(-w*i)) for i in [0, inf])   # Formulating recurring part as a summation
#         = (1/10^w) * (c / (1 - 10^(-w))                       # Substitute in formula for geometric series
#         = c / (10^w * (1 - 10^(-w))                           # Combine fractions
#         = c / (10^w - 1)                                      # Simplify
#
#     Thus any recurring fraction `S` can be written as c/(10^w-1) for some `c` and `w`.
#     Note that the denominator is 99...9, with 9 appearing `w` times.
#     For example, 0.(12345)* = 12345/99999
#
# Extension:
#     The recurring representation can be extended to accommodate fixed prefixes.
#     For example, we might have 0.7(12345)*, so there is a prefix of '7'.
#     We can decompose this with the following:
#       S = 0.7(12345)*
#         = 0.7 + (1/10) * 0.(12345)*
#         = 7/10 + (1/10) * S'
#         = (S'+7)/10
#
#     Here, we know S' is a recurring decimal number, and can be represented as a fraction.
#     S is thus another fraction.
